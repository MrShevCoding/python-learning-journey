I bought this course at Novemeber 24 2025, low price of 12.99 around (it cost $100 so that was a STEAL) and a heard good things about it. I did this challenge also with a friend, 
so we both motivate each other to finish and understand python from scratch to begginger, both of are in high school (currently) and we need to get these concepts solidified 
nice and solidified.
