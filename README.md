# python-learning-journey
This is my learning journey from beginner to more advanced topics/concepts. This contains from start to beginning all my projects, dev logs (my opinions, thoughts, and progress), and how I learnt. Note, this is how learned and people learned differently, I will list all my sources and tools I used but note this Repo is how learnt python. Enjoy :)
